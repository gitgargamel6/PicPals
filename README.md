PicPals was a final-year supervised project.
Since the topic was open-ended, we chose to create a multi-platform social network with an API and a database.

Named PicPals, this social network offers a simple concept: bringing together drawing enthusiasts every day around a phrase.
Indeed, the application users are notified once a day about the appearance of a new phrase, to which they can associate a drawing inspired by their imagination.
To enhance the playful aspect of the social network, the phrase is the same for all users, and they cannot see their friends' drawings until they have drawn their own.

For API management, the application uses an Express server communicating with a MongoDB database. 
As for UI, this project uses Flutter, the powerful Google Framework which facilitates multi-platform development.
